- filtering based on CPU percentage, name etc
eg. ./locksmith -> find cpu>50 & mem>20 & user=naderrahhal
eg. find last24hr, 

- easier commands for killing
eg. ./locksmith -> kill [pid]
- can do name killing too, but must warn user there are many with name


Concurrency:

Initialization:
- Both locks (unprocessed and processed buffers) are free.
- Producer starts running.

Producer Stage (Collect Data)
- Acquires unprocessed buffer lock.
- Writes new data into the unprocessed buffer.
- Releases unprocessed buffer lock.
- Signals consumer that data is ready.

Consumer Stage (Process Data & Update UI)
- Waits until the producer signals that new data is available.
- Acquires unprocessed buffer lock, moves data to a local variable, and releases the lock (minimizing lock time).
- Processes the data (without holding a lock).
- Acquires processed buffer lock, updates processed buffer, then releases it.
- Signals the UI thread that new data is available.

UI Stage: 
- Waits for a signal from the consumer
- Acquires processed buffer lock
- Reads processed data
- Releases lock
- Renders data to the ncurses UI
- Refresh
